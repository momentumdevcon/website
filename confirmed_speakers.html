                            <p>When we survey the current landscape of emerging technologies such as Voice interfaces, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality - it's easy to become a bit disillusioned. Many of the early products can feel a bit gimmicky and not relevant to our day-to-day activities. In this session, we'll talk about the real potential of these technologies and focus on how to change our strategy and development approach to build valuable solutions with them.</p>

                            <p>New features are constantly being added to Microsofts flagship language, C#, and the pace of this change is increasing. In the past couple of years, we welcomed C# 6 and C# 7, the last languages release of their size. Microsoft is now releasing updates to the language in point releases, since C# is no longer so coupled to Visual Studio. In 2017 alone, Microsoft shipped C# versions 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 without any sign of slowing. </br></br>Normally, sessions about new language features only happen well before the release of the new language, leaving you with time to forget everything you've learned by the time you're actually able to adopt the new language! In this fast-paced session, Brendan will show you the recent, practical improvements added to C# that you can take back with you and immediately start using to clean up and improve your own code. This is definitely a session you won't want to miss!</p>

                            <p>In the tech industry, we often think our jobs have narrowly defined skillsets. We believe that staying in our lanes, gaining more years of experience, and learning new technical skills yields automatic career growth. This is a mistake! For continual career growth, we must also venture into the worlds of business and communication. This talk will explain why these worlds matter to your career. You'll discover how to gain and apply this knowledge at work even if it's not part of your job. You'll also learn how leveraging the tech community enhances your business and communication skills alongside your technical skills. This session will leave you challenged to go beyond your job description and drive your career forward.</p>

                            <p>If you're doing front end development, chances are you have a favorite web framework. If you've been doing it for any length of time, you've probably had several. And with good reason: good frameworks have made our developer lives more productive and enjoyable. However, they continue to come along at a dizzying pace and each one is generally incompatible with the last. At the same time, browsers have continued to innovate and standardize many of the great ideas that web frameworks invented. It's worth asking ourselves if it's time to thank web frameworks for their service and climb off the treadmill. In this talk, I'll explore the experience of building a web app using nothing other than browser available APIs. We'll talk about some of the new browser standards that have been inspired by the best of web frameworks. We'll take a look at some good ideas in web app development that don't require a framework or API to implement. We'll do all this with plenty of code examples.</p>

                            <p>Compilers are the bridge between the code you write and the applications you run. While production compilers can be quite complicated, the principles of compiler design are not too hard to learn, and are broadly applicable to many seemingly difficult programming problems. In this session you will learn how every phase of a real compiler works, including lexing, parsing, type checking, optimization, and code generation. The lessons learned here will help you with many common programming problems, such as deserialization, maintaining large amounts of legacy code, static analysis, testing, and validation. In contrast to common Java-based compiler tutorials, I'll demonstrate how to build a compiler using functional programming techniques in F#. Full source code for a working compiler targeting the .NET CLR will be included!</p>

                            <p>Web applications are going to take the native app stores by storm in 2018. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that work seamlessly for every user on every device, and they are ready to change the way we build and deploy our software. Each PWA is an application that works online or offline, on old devices and new, and that users can install just like a native app on your device. This talk will cover PWAs and the technologies that make them possible: Service Workers, Fetch API, and Web App Manifest. You'll leave this talk ready to create new PWAs and add native-like experiences to your existing apps.</p>

                            <p>A toaster stores data without SQL and without tables. But making a choice based on what something doesn't have isn't terribly useful. NoSQL is an increasingly inaccurate catch-all term that covers a lot of different types of data storage. To make more sense of this new breed of database management systems, the buzzword is not good enough. In this session, the four main data models that make up the NoSQL movement will be covered: key-value, document, columnar and graph. How they differ and when to use each one will be discussed.</br></br>This session will be looking at the whole ecosystem, with a more detailed focus on Couchbase, Cassandra, Riak KV, and Neo4j.</p>

At Kroger, we use Nginx as a reverse proxy to route traffic with a configuration that is thousands of lines long with pull requests from dozens of teams. Even with this scale, we are still able to complete on-demand deployments to multiple environments that serve dozens of domains and route to over 50 applications clusters with zero downtime. We show an open source framework, SnowGlobe, which allows us to simulate and test every possible traffic routing situation before we deploy. We use a full CI/CD pipeline with 7,000+ tests run for every commit. </p>

In this talk, you'll learn how to solve a series of real world problems by applying patterns. Not only do patterns help individual developers solve particular problems, but they also enable teams to discuss design decisions using a richer, more descriptive language. By the end, you'll have some concrete tools you can apply, and hopefully the desire to master more patterns as you continue to improve!</p>

People with this autoimmune disease have to constantly monitor & control their food, blood glucose, insulin, physical activity and other factors. Even with advancements like insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring, the process is still manual and error prone. What if someone with T1D could delegate the constant cycle of monitoring, predicting and controlling to a computer in their pocket? In this session, you'll learn about an open source project called the Open Artificial Pancreas System, or OpenAPS, and how it closes the loop on a cycle that the rest of us take for granted. Then we'll explore how Elixir and the Nerves project are being used to build a next generation artificial pancreas system. We'll touch briefly on the topics of hardware prototyping and reverse engineering along with how it all came together in one project.</p>
