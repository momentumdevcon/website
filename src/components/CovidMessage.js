      We were optimistic.  We kept hoping things would significantly change. But, as you know, COVID-19 continues to present challenges.  
      With the current guidelines set out by the CDC and State of Ohio given by Governor DeWine, 
      we have unfortunately had to make the tough decision to cancel our 2020 Momentum Conference scheduled for October 16, 2020.
      Though we are sad that we cannot make this year happen, we are eager and looking forward to a great event for the fall of 2021.  
      Our new tentative date will be Friday, October 15, 2021 at The Hyatt downtown. We hope to see you there!
