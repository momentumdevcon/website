We really hoped that we’d be past this at this point, but COVID-19 continues to be a concern on the local and global stage, and **Momentum is taking it very seriously**. We recognize that everyone has different perspectives and risk calculations. As with all things, it is difficult to please everyone. Please know that—all else being equal—**we will continue to err on the side of caution** with respect to protecting the health and safety of our attendees, speakers, partners, staff, and volunteers.

The situation is fluid. We are keeping a close eye on the everchanging guidelines. Our team is focused on providing a safe, enjoyable, and successful in-person experience for the developer community.  We kindly request that you respect the decisions and policies that we put in place.

### Refund Policy
**Tickets to Momentum 2021 are non-refundable within thirty (30) days of the event.**

**Momentum** is a **community-run, not-for-profit event**, and we have our own non-refundable commitments to our vendors. To survive, we must remain financially viable, and that does drive our ticketing and refund policy.

If you are unable to attend, and **you cancel between 15 and 30 days prior** to Momentum, we can carry forward your current ticket registration to Momentum 2022.

Any **cancellation requests within 15 days of the event are not eligible for a refund or a 2022 carryover** and can only be transferred to another colleague or friend for Momentum 2021.

### Event Format
We are convinced nothing can truly replace the experience of coming together and learning together, connecting with old friends and making new ones. **Momentum is committed to being held as an in-person event** at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Cincinnati. In addition to any policies stated on our website, the venue may have additional, specific rules pertaining to COVID and public health.  We will be following those rules as well.

### CDC, State, and Local Rules
We will be following the **guidelines and recommendation of public health officials** from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, State of Ohio, Hamilton County and City of Cincinnati departments of health. 

We will continue to monitor expectations for large events and make any necessary adjustments as needed. Please note that it is impossible to precisely predict what these guidelines will be in mid-October. 

### Mask Policy
We will be following CDC and public health official recommendations, as well as all local guidelines and mandates.

At this time, we expect that masks *will be required* at Momentum 2021. If you are not following the requirements in place at the time of the event, one of our staff or venue security may ask you to comply. Failure or refusal to do so may result in removal from the venue, by venue security or law enforcement **without refund**.

This policy could change for any reason, including national or local positive test rates, serious disease or hospitalization incidence rate, changing national or local regulations, etc. We understand this is difficult and, for some, is a divisive issue. **Momentum will err on the side of safety because we care about you and your health**, and we appreciate your understanding.

### Vaccination Policy
Again, we are following the CDC and Department of Health rules for vaccination recommendations.

We strongly **encourage and ask that all Momentum participants who are eligible and medically capable** to have received a full COVID-19 vaccination at least two weeks prior to the start of the in-person event on October 15.

We are not currently prepared to verify vaccination status due to legal, logistic, and health privacy considerations, and accordingly, do not expect to be checking vaccinations at registration.

As with the masking policy, this could change for any reason, including national or local positive test rates, serious disease or hospitalization incidence rate, changing national or local regulations, improved capability for straightforward vaccination certification, etc.

### Policy Enforcement
Please do not attend Momentum if you are sick or feeling unwell, if you are currently covered by a COVID-19 quarantine protocol, or if you are currently awaiting COVID-19 test results. We reserve the right to do a temperature check and deny entry for people showing clear signs of illness.

A single violation of the rules can result in removal from the venue, by venue security or law enforcement.
