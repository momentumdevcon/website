# TL;DR

Momentum 2023 will be very similar to Momentum 2022 with some slight tweaks.
- There is no lunch break.
- Breaks between sessions are 20 minutes instead of 15 minutes
- The only sessions in the "main room" are the Opening and Closing Remarks, plus lunch.

## Session Schedule


- 8:45-9:00 Opening Remarks
- 9:10-5:00 Sessions - 7 time slots, 50 minutes each
- 5:10-5:30 Closing Remarks and Giveaways

### Opening Remarks

The best way to kick off Momentum 2023 is gathered with hundreds of other attendees. You‚Äôre not here to listen to me, so I‚Äôll make sure this session delivers maximum value per minute. I‚Äôll share important details for the day and a few thoughts to get you going. We‚Äôll also do a giveaway during the Opening Remarks and you must be present to win!

### Sessions

Momentum 2023 has 35 50-minute sessions, scheduled in 7 time slots with 5 simultaneous sessions each. There is a 20 minute break between time slots. **There is no lunch break.** We will explain more about this in the next section.

Review the schedule before you arrive, so that you can plan for the talks you most want to attend. Accept that your plan will probably change. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Some popular sessions may reach capacity. If a session is particularly important to you, arrive early to claim a good seat.

### Closing Remarks

Win free stuff! Have a proper send-off! Celebrate a successful Momentum!

To end the day, we'll meet in the main ballroom at 5:10 for Closing Remarks.

I know that this is the final session of a long, tiring day and I will do my best to keep it short.

## Food Schedule

I love good food. I hope you love good food too. Here's the times when you can get it.

| Meal        | Start Time  | End Time
| ----------- | ----------- | --------
| Breakfast   | 8:00 AM     | 9:00 AM
| Lunch       | 11:10 AM    | 1:10 PM
| Snack       | TBA         | TBA

### Lunch

**_This is important and different from prior years_**

**Momentum 2023 does not have a dedicated lunch break.** Lunch will be available from 11:10 to 1:10 in the main ballroom. Grab lunch at any time within this two hour block, whenever it works best for you. Choose your own adventure! The session rhythm will continue unbroken and unmarred.

Options include:

- Eat lunch quickly between sessions
- Eat lunch during the 11:30 session
- Eat lunch during the 12:40 session

I don‚Äôt recommend skipping lunch entirely but I‚Äôm not your mom, so that‚Äôs between you and your stomach.

You can view the full menu for the day, including lunch, on our [Food page](/food).

Once you‚Äôve finished lunch, you may want to join a session that‚Äôs already in progress. That‚Äôs great! Just remember to be polite and avoid creating any unnecessary disturbance to those already in the session.

## Sponsors

There are over a dozen sponsor booths, staffed by friendly people, lining the main hallway. Many of them will be giving away free stuff! Our sponsors help keep Momentum affordable and fun, and I am very thankful for that. Grab a fidget spinner or a t-shirt then take a moment to say ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù and thank them for their support.

### Meet the Sponsors

We‚Äôll be giving away several items that you can only win by completing a ‚ÄúMeet the Sponsors‚Äù sheet. As you visit each sponsor, they will stamp your sheet in the appropriate square. Once your sheet is full, bring it to the main desk to enter in the drawing of your choice. The drawing will occur during the closing remarks. You must be present to win!



Question:  
Why is there not a lunch break? You are forcing me to miss part of the event!

Answer:  
If we stopped the sessions for a lunch break, we would have 5 less sessions at Momentum. You would have fewer choices, not more. If it makes you feel better, just pretend there are no 11:30 sessions.
