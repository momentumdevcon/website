# Momentum Registration Guide

You want tickets for Momentum 2024. That's great! We want to make it easy and convenient for you to get tickets for Momentum 2024. This guide will hopefully answer some of your questions. If you're ever unsure, just drop an email to tickets@momentumdevcon.com and we'll get you sorted right away.

# Step 1: Buy the Tickets
Tickets are conveniently available through our website, https://momentumdevcon.com.
We use Tito as our ticketing provider to facilitate a smooth and simple process.

You can purchase tickets via PayPal (using credit card or any other payment they offer) or via invoice. PayPal is processed instantly. Invoice requires you to mail us a check. 

We recommend PayPal. It's a lot less hassle and we don't have to track you down to make sure you send the payment!

# Step 2: Allocate the tickets
## I'm buying a Momentum ticket for myself

This is simple! Buy your ticket, assign it to yourself, answer a few questions, no big deal. You can answer the questions later instead **but** *we will nag you about it if you forget*.

## I'm buying Momentum tickets for others

Don't panic, with a simple trick, this process is easier than you expect! All you need are the attendees' names and emails. They will fill out the rest.

Once you purchase the tickets, you'll see this prompt:

Your purchase is complete but your tickets aren't assigned. If you like, you *can* stop now and go about your day. But the tickets aren't very useful until you give them to attendees.

To do that, click the button to "Assign your tickets" then select "For somebody else". You'll see something like this form:

Enter the attendee's name and email address (and something for the job title) **then click "I don't have this info right now"**. All the bothersome attendee questions will disappear!

Click "Send". The attendee will receive an email with their ticket and a link to answer the necessary questions. Allocate all the tickets and your job is done! 

Reduced hassle for purchasers, improved experience for attendees, and accurate information for the Momentum team: I call that a win-win-win!

## But I'm purchasing a lot of tickets!
We can help make the process easier! Message me at michael@momentumdevcon.com and we will come up with a plan that works for you. Whether you are sharing tickets to various managers or need to track your allocations, we have the tools to support you!

# Follow Up

It is _vital_ that each attendee gets the email with their ticket. This will make it super easy for them to check in at Momentum. As we get closer to the conference, the team will also be sending useful and important information to  attendees via email.

The registration emails are sent from `support@tito.io` under the name "Momentum 2024". While Tito takes all the necessary steps to prove email authenticity, we have occasionally seen corporate email filters send these messages to spam. If you notice this happening, you may want to check with your collaboration team to add an exception for this email address.

# Thank you!
Your support for Momentum helps to grow the local and regional developer community. We appreciate it and we're excited to see you on October 17th!
