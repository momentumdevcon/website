# TL;DR

The schedule for Momentum 2024 is nearly identical to Momentum 2023.
- There are five session rooms, with seven 50-minute sessions in each room
- Breaks between sessions are 20 minutes long
- Lunch is offered for 2-hours (11:10-1:10) and there is no "lunch break".
- The only sessions in the "main room" are the Opening and Closing Remarks, plus lunch.

## Conference Schedule

- 8:45-9:00 Opening Remarks
- 9:10-5:00 Sessions - 7 time slots, 50 minutes each
- 5:10-5:30 Closing Remarks and Giveaways
- 5:30-8:00 After-party at Brewdog

### Opening Remarks

The best way to kick off Momentum 2024 is gathered with hundreds of other attendees. You didn't come to Momentum to listen to me, so I‚Äôll make sure this session delivers maximum value per minute. You'll get important details for the day and some words of wisdom to supercharge your experience. We‚Äôll also do a giveaway during the Opening Remarks and you must be present to win!

### Sessions

Momentum 2024 has 35 50-minute sessions, scheduled in 7 time slots with 5 simultaneous sessions each. There is a 20 minute break between time slots. **There is no lunch break.** I will explain more about this in the next section.

Review the schedule before you arrive, so that you can plan for the talks you most want to attend. Accept that your plan will probably change. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Some popular sessions may reach capacity. If a session is particularly important to you, _arrive early to claim a good seat._

### Closing Remarks

Win free stuff! Reflect on what you learned! Celebrate a successful Momentum!

To end the day, we'll meet in the main ballroom at 5:10 for Closing Remarks.

I know that this is the final session of a long, tiring day. I will keep it short and sweet.

### After-party

Come celebrate with us at Brewdog!

Immediately after the closing remarks, walk across the street to Brewdog for delicious (free!) food and great company. We'll have volunteers conveniently stationed to steer you on your way. Your conference badge gets you in the door, so bring it with you to Brewdog.

We've reserved the entire venue for our beloved Momentum attendees. This is the perfect chance to hang with your Momentum friends and make a few more connections.

Do you like pinball? We'll be providing the quarters for Brewdog's lineup of pinball machines. 

## Food Schedule

I love good food. I hope you love good food too. Here's the times when you can get it.

| Meal        | Start Time  | End Time
| ----------- | ----------- | --------
| Breakfast   | 7:30 AM     | 9:30 AM
| Lunch       | 11:10 AM    | 1:10 PM
| Snack       | 1:30 PM     | 3:00 PM

### Lunch

**_This is important and different from many other events_**

**Momentum 2024 does not have a dedicated lunch break.** Lunch will be available from 11:10 to 1:10 in the main ballroom. Grab lunch at any time within this two hour block, whenever you like. Choose your own adventure! The session rhythm will continue unbroken and unmarred.

Options include:

- Eat lunch quickly between sessions
- Eat lunch during the 11:30 session
- Eat lunch during the 12:40 session

I don‚Äôt recommend skipping lunch entirely but I‚Äôm not your mom, so that‚Äôs between you and your stomach.

You can view the full menu for the day, including lunch, on our [Food page](/food).

Once you‚Äôve finished lunch, you may want to join a session that‚Äôs already in progress. That‚Äôs great! Just remember to be polite and avoid creating any unnecessary disturbance to those already in the session.

## Sponsors

There are over a dozen sponsor booths, staffed by friendly people, lining the main hallway. Many of them will be giving away free stuff! Our sponsors help keep Momentum affordable and fun, and I am very thankful for that. Grab a fidget spinner or a t-shirt then take a moment to say ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù and thank them for their support.

### Meet the Sponsors

We‚Äôll be giving away several items that you can only win by completing a ‚ÄúMeet the Sponsors‚Äù sheet. As you visit each sponsor, they will stamp your sheet in the appropriate square. Once your sheet is full, bring it to the main desk to enter in the drawing of your choice. The drawing will occur during the closing remarks. You must be present to win!
